		  	<![CDATA[Atelectasis refers to lung collapse. It is divided into four types. Absorptive (obstructive) atelectasis results from airway obstruction, such as occurs with mucus, tumors, or foreign bodies. The air within the lungs distal to the obstruction is absorbed, the lung collapses, and the mediastinum then shifts toward the collapsed lung. With compression, atelectasis fluid within the pleural cavity, such as seen with congestive heart failure (CHF), causes increased pleural pressure, which collapses lung tissue. In this instance the mediastinum shifts away from the collapsed lung. In contraction, atelectasis fibrosis causes collapse of lung tissue. Patchy atelectasis may result from loss of pulmonary surfactant, which is seen in hyaline membrane disease of the newborn.Atelectasis refers to lung collapse. It is divided into four types.

			  <![CDATA[ An 85-year-old with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes, and alcohol-induced dilated cardiomyopathy presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. In an effort to treat himself, he recently restarted a  course of calcium channel blockers prescribed years ago by his previous cardiologist. Physical examination yields significant jugular venous distention, an S<font face='Arial' size='8' >3</font>, and diffuse rales bilaterally. X-ray film of the chest reveals pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. ]]>
