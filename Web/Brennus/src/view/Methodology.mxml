Work is structured in cycles of work called sprints, iterations of work that are typically two to four weeks in duration. During each sprint, teams pull from a prioritized list of customer requirements, called user stories, so that the features that are developed first are of the highest value to the customer. At the end of each sprint, a potentially shippable product is delivered
				<br><b>A simple framework</b><br>Scrum is made up of three roles, three ceremonies, and three artifacts.
				<br><b>Three roles:</b><br>the Product Owner, who is responsible for the business value of the project; the ScrumMaster, who ensures that the team is functional and productive; and the self organized team. Read more about Scrum roles.
				<br><b>Three ceremonies:</b><br>the sprint planning meeting, daily scrum meetings, and sprint review meetings.
				<br><b>Three artifacts for prioritizing and tracking tasks:</b><br>the product backlog, the sprint backlog, and a burndown chart.
				<br>A time tested process Scrum has become one of the leading agile development methodologies, used by Fortune 500 companies around the world.</p>
