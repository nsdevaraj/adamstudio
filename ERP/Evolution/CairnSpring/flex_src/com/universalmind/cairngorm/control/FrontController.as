     * The UniversalMind FrontController is used as a "super"
     * cairngorm controller to allow modules to register their own sub-controllers
     * as part of the application set.
     * 
     * <p>
     * Often applications are developed with distinct modules (dynamically loaded
     * or static compiled). These modules may contain their own mini-Cairngorm MVC
     * but need to be used with the scope of an application MVC; used without namespace
     * conflicts or overrides.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Each subcontroller maps its own events to its own commands. This allows modules 
     * sub-MVCs to be "plugged" into other applications easily.
